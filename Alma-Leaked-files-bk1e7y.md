Alma's breakthrough exhibition came in 2015, when she showcased her work at the Saatchi Gallery in London. The exhibition, titled "Reflections," featured a series of large-scale paintings that explored the theme of self-reflection. The exhibition was a critical and commercial success, with many art critics praising Alma's unique artistic vision and her ability to connect with viewers on a deep emotional level. Born in 1995, Alma grew up in a musical family and began singing at a young age. She was heavily influenced by artists such as Adele, Florence + The Machine, and Lorde, and began writing her own songs as a teenager. After completing her education, Alma released her debut single "Lost in the Moment" in 2017, which quickly gained traction online and caught the attention of music industry professionals.
